# Java Quiz Exam Management System

This project is associated with Object-Oriented Visual Programming (OOVP) Course in the 2nd semester of my study. We were using Apache NetBeans IDE 17 as the code editor. Implemented the 4 pillars of OOP in the application with connection to MySQL as the database system.

## Project Overview

The Online Quiz Exam Management System is a Java-based application designed to revolutionize the way educators create, manage, and grade quizzes, and how students take them. It addresses the challenges faced in traditional and existing online assessment methods, providing a seamless and efficient solution for both educators and students.

### Key Features

- **Admin Panel**: Allows educators to create, manage, and assess quizzes
- **Student Panel**: Provides a user-friendly interface for students to take quizzes
- **Question Management**: Add, update, delete, and view all questions
- **Result Management**: View and analyze student results
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system for admins and students

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Swing (for GUI)
- MySQL (for database management)
- JDBC (for database connectivity)

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Implemented

1. **Encapsulation**: Implemented through private instance variables and public methods
2. **Inheritance**: Utilized by extending JFrame class in various UI components
3. **Polymorphism**: Demonstrated in event handling methods
4. **Abstraction**: Applied in the overall structure of the application, hiding complex implementations behind simple interfaces

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up MySQL database using the provided SQL script
3. Open the project in Apache NetBeans IDE 17
4. Configure the database connection in the project
5. Run the application

## Usage

### For Admins
- Login using admin credentials
- Add, update, or delete questions
- View all questions and student results

### For Students
- Enter student details
- Take the quiz
- View results immediately after completion
